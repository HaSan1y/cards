- intention of this website: crud operations (nodejs, indexDB, supabase, vercel, sqllite, postgresql, ...)... that was the plan, turns out i was wrong when i created this project(though it can still function with indexdb+if ur willing to put ur own server setup).
- doing crud on vanillajs(with exposing api) would be actually not secure and dumb... for you it means if u want to c my crud capabilities, check out different projects that i have. which do provide the utility- backend.
- for example:"nextjs react project nextjs-h451.vercel.app, django project https://github.com/HaSan1y/spotify-python_django-rapidapi, c# project(maui+asp.net mvc)(currently offline), php project https://github.com/HaSan1y/some-php, react native project (currently offline),
